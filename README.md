# MyList
## To-Do List app created using Ruby on Rails framework.

You just need to clone the repository, install the dependencies and then run the two commands below (make sure you are in the `./MyList` folder):

```
bundle install
rails s
```

The server will start running, then you just need to open `htttp://localhost:3000/` and you're ready to test the app!
